AI-SOC 365

100% Coded AI-Driven Security Operations Centre (SOC) – Fully Automated & Proud to share a major milestone in our cybersecurity innovation journey.

We have successfully developed and tested a fully coded AI-Driven Security Operations Centre (SOC) Auto-Management System integrated with the Wazuh open-source platform.

What makes this powerful?
✅ End-to-end automated SOC operations
✅ AI-driven alert correlation & prioritization
✅ Automated incident triage and response workflows
✅ Intelligent threat validation & noise reduction
✅ Scalable architecture for enterprise environments

This is not limited to basic agentic AI concepts . it is a production-ready, coded system designed for real-world SOC optimization.

📡 Next Phase:
 Integration with IBM QRadar SIEM is underway, enabling hybrid SIEM intelligence and advanced threat orchestration capabilities.

Our goal is clear:
 ➡ Reduce human fatigue in SOC
 ➡ Increase detection accuracy
 ➡ Accelerate response time
 ➡ Enable autonomous security operations

AI is no longer just assisting security teams. it is operationalizing cybersecurity at scale.
